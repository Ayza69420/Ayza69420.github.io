A simple yet efficient AI first implemented in python, then remade in javascript.

# Input

- Features
  - Age
  - Gender  
- Prediction target
  - Genre  

Example of valid input:

23 male rock // a 23 year old male likes rock  
29 male rock // a 29 year old male likes rock  
24 male // based on the given data, predict what genre a 24 male likes

# Important notes

- Gender could be one of male/female, and it is not case sensitive.
- This AI cannot predict what is lower/higher than the minimum/maximum age in the given data to keep it as accurrate as I can
